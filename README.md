# Tailwind initiallization

- This repo is a skeleton repo with just the basic details. This can be used to initialize tailwind if one can not use tailwind through npx tailwind init
- This is a basic react + vite project. Clone this repo, delete the .git folder and use npm install and npm run dev to start running
- In order to change this from Javascript to type scrpit, change the app.jsx and main.jsx to .tsx files and initalize typescript normally
